I am a linguistics PhD student who works on **semantics, syntax, morphology and their interfaces**, strongly emphasizing language documentation and **fieldwork methodologies**. Currently I am in my third year at **Rutgers University**, where most of my recent work has been on nominal structures and semantics in **White Hmong** (my partner's language).

### Language experience

But, I have worked with a range of languages. The language groups I have experience with are **Algonquian** (Ojibwe, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Shinnecock), **Hmong-Mien** (White Hmong), **Semitic** (Arabic varieties), and **Polynesian** (Cook Islands Māori). In field methods courses, I have also worked with an **Igbo** speaker and a **Yemba** speaker.

### Academic journey

My language interests during my undergraduate degree at the University of Minnesota were theoretical syntax and Semitic languages (my minor was in Arabic). In a field methods course there, my interest shifted to Algonquian, after working with a Southwest Ojibwe speaker. Since this shift was near the end of my undergraduate program, while I was studying for my masters degree I mainly worked on Plains Algonquian (Cheyenne and Arapaho).
