I'm a linguist from Northwest Arkansas who works on semantics, syntax, morphology and their interfaces, strongly emphasizing language documentation and fieldwork. 

The language groups I have experience with are Algonquian (Ojibwe, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Shinnecock), Hmong-Mien (White Hmong), Semitic (Arabic varieties), and Polynesian (Cook Islands Māori).
